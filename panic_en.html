    <h1>How does it work?</h1>
	<p>The application displays schedules for a period of two hours. If there's no
	  travel at the date, a message will invite you to select a different period.</p>
	<p>You can select a different period, with either the clock button or by using 
	  a double-tap on the left-most (respectivly right-most) column.</p>
	<p>Regarding the favorites, the arrow indicates the general direction (West, East,...)
	  of the corresponding travel. Only the 5 most consulted favorites are displayed
	  on the home page.</p>
